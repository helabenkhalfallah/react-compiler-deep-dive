## Why Speed is a Fundamental Need?

> A snappy user experience beats a glamorous one, for the simple reason that people engage more with a site when they can move freely and focus on the content instead of on their endless wait. - https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/

In today's digital-first world, speed and seamless functionality outweigh aesthetic appeal. [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/brainfood-mobile-performance-vol3.pdf) reports that page load speed ranks as the most critical factor in user satisfaction, with 75% of users prioritizing it above all else. Without a fast, responsive experience, users are significantly less likely to engage with a site's content or design. In this sense, speed is no longer merely a technical metric - it's a cornerstone of engagement and loyalty.

The relationship between speed and satisfaction is rooted in [human psychology](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed-1997/):
- Immediate Gratification: Delays disrupt cognition, leading to frustration and loss of focus. Slow applications feel like obstacles, damaging user trust.
- Sense of Control: Instantaneous responses make users feel empowered and autonomous, whereas long waits evoke helplessness.
- Cognitive Limits: Delays increase cognitive load, forcing users to hold more information in memory, which can lead to errors or task abandonment.

By prioritizing performance in development and design, we create user experiences that empower, engage, and retain audiences.
